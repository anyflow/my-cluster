# My Cluster (DRAFT)
This project aims to 'quickly' set up and tear down a Kubernetes and various apps in the cluster within a single host. The primary purpose is to acquire knowledge about their usage and to conduct tests.

## Objectives
- **Enable installation/deletion of apps, including Kubernetes itself, with a 'single command'**
  - The goal is to restart from the initial setup at any time, ensuring that the installation/deletion process itself doesn't become a bottleneck in understanding Kubernetes and the apps.
- **Make it operable in a single host**
  - Essentially, to function as a home server/cluster. Naturally, this includes exposure to the internet.

## Test Results
Operating on a MacBook Pro from 2011 (w/ 16G Memory) under Ubuntu Linux (Refer to the [My Cluster & its assets](https://www.anyflow.net) section for more information).

## Prerequisites
- **`docker`**: Being based on Kubernetes, a container runtime is naturally required. `podman` might also be feasible as it is supported by the below-mentioned `kind`, though it hasn't been tested.
- **`kind`**: A runtime that supports Kubernetes on a single host based on containers. Installation guides for various OS are well documented in the [official kind guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
- **`kubectl`**: The basic command module for Kubernetes. This also has installation guides for various OS in the `kubectl` section of the [official Kubernetes guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
- **Wildcard Certificate**: Used by `default-gateway`, the primary Gateway of MyCluster, for exposing apps over TLS. The method for linking domains for each app is explained in the [1. Setting up `.env`](#1-setting-up-env) section. The files should be placed in the PEM format as follows:
  - **Fullchain Certificate**: `/cert/fullchain.pem`
  - **Private Key**: `/cert/privkey.pem`

## Usage
All commands use `Makefile` rules. Most commands involve creating or deleting apps, including Kubernetes itself. The naming convention for the rules is `{name}-c` for creation (create) and `{name}-d` for deletion (delete). Below are examples for Kubernetes cluster and Prometheus.

```sh
# Kubernetes cluster
make cluster-c    # creation
make cluster-d    # deletion

# Prometheus
make prometheus-c # creation
make prometheus-d # deletion
```

For specialized aspects of each app, refer to the `README.md` in each app directory in [`/apps`](./apps) directory.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting up `.env`
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and enter the domain values for each app as shown below. The `...anyflow.net` shown here is an example, and you should input the actual domain name you intend to use(refer to [`sample.env`](sample.env)).

```sh
DOMAIN_ARGOCD=argocd.anyflow.net
DOMAIN_DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker-registry.anyflow.net
...
```

### 2. Create a cluster and set cluster-level app, configuration
The specific content and procedures for installing/configuring Kubernetes and cluster levels are as follows. For each app, refer to the above usage instructions and install separately as needed.


```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/anyflow/my-cluster.git

# 2. Change current working directory
cd my-cluster

# 3. Create Kubernetes cluster, configurate cluster level app, settings.
make initialize
```

Note that the `initialize`` rule internally calls the following rules:

1. **`prometheus-cr-c`**: Creates the Kubernetes cluster.
2. **`metallb-c`**: Installs Load Balancer (metallb), used by the Kubernetes API.
3. **`prometheus-cepo-c`**: Installs app-specific helm repositories.
4. **`istio-c`**: Installs istio.
5. **`config-c`**: Sets up cluster level configuration, e.g., namespace, metallb, gateway, (and ingress).

```

## Design Decisions

### Using `kind`
Instead of Minikube, [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is used, as when this project was initially created, Minikube did not support multi-node setups, and Kubernetes nodes are emulated as containers, making it **lightweight**. This is especially relevant for Kubernetes development. For reference, the first option for operating Kubernetes in a local environment in the [Kubernetes Official Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) is `kind`, not Minikube.

### Using Only Two Namespaces: `cluster` and `istio-system`
Other namespaces are not used for convenience. `istio-system` is specifically chosen because using `istio` and its eco family in other namespaces often requires extensive trial and error.

### Using `Kubernetes Gateway API` Instead of `Ingress`
The `Kubernetes Gateway API` is a new Kubernetes API that replaces `ingress`. It is used by default to expose Kubernetes Services externally. This project includes some configurations for `ingress` as well, but they are commented out and turned off. [Replace Ingress with Kubernetes Gateway API](https://www.anyflow.net/sw-engineer/replace-ingress-into-gatewayapi) (Korean) provides a detailed explanation on this topic.


### Three Worker Nodes
Considering it operates locally, using three worker nodes is unnecessary. However, they are set to three for testing sharding and replication in systems like `Elasticsearch` and `MongoDB`. If deemed unnecessary, you can configure it to just one node in the `kind-config.yaml` file.
